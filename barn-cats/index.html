      <h1>Working Cat Program</h1>
      <h3>(Formerly known as our Barn Cat Program)</h3>
        <p>
          We are looking for cat lovers who have a barn or other secure structure (warehouse, brewery, etc - heated in winter) interested in adopting cats not suitable for life inside of a home. 
          This program is designed to find homes for community cats traditionally deemed unadoptable through local shelter programs. These are cats who cannot be returned to their outdoor colony caretaker due to an extreme danger, like someone shooting or poisoning cats.
          Cat temperaments range from semi-friendly to feral. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We adopt out working cats in pairs or trios. If you would like to adopt working cats, please fill out the barn cat application and someone will be in contact with you shortly.

          <li>A warm, secure, dry barn or building in which the cats can live out their lives.</li>
          <li>The commitment and ability to keep the cats confined to a crate (we can provide) or exercise pen with a wire top for 4 to 5 weeks so that the cats can safely acclimate to their new environment before release.</li>
          <li>A clean litter box that is scooped and/or cleaned daily while confined.</li>
          <li>A constant supply of dry food and fresh water - even after release from confinement. While confined and after release, you will need to provide a small amount of canned food daily.</li>
          <li>Monitoring health needs and providing for the safety and well-being of the cats.</li>
          <li>Spending time daily making verbal contact with the cats so they become familiar with you.</li>

      <h1>FAQs</h1>
      <h2>What is the Adoption Fee?</h2>
      <p>
        Although Urban Cat Coalition does not charge an adoption fee for barn cats, we are a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that relies on your monetary contributions to operate. 
        Your generous donation helps pay for spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations (and other medical treatment if necessary), ear tipping, and much more! Any donation you can make is much appreciated!
      </p>
      <h2>Why Multiple Cats?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/safe-relocation/" target="_blank">Alley Cat Allies</a> recommends that at least two cats always be moved together. They should be cats who have formed a bond or at least get along with each other. 
        The move will be less traumatic and adjustment to their new home more successful if they have the security of one or more trusted companions.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Confine the Cats for 4-5 Weeks?</h2>
      <p>
        In order to familiarize the cats with their new environment, so they know this is their new home and they will remain on the premises. Without this confinement period most cats will run off, never to be seen again. 
        Not only is that extremely dangerous for the cats, this can be traumatic for the caregiver who has usually put a lot of time, energy, funds, and care into these cats.
        Some people see confinement as cruel, but a short confinement period is a very necessary part of relocation. Having the cats run off often means a far worse fate. 
      </p>
      <h2>How Are the Cats Confined?</h2>
      <p>
        The adopter should be equipped with an extra-large dog crate or a large exercise pen covered with mesh wire (UCC can lend these supplies, to be returned at the end of the confinement period). 
        The adopter must provide a litterbox and food/water within the crate. It is recommended that a portion of the cage/crate be covered with a sheet. 
        This will allow the cats to feel more protected and hidden. In winter, the crate should be bedded with straw. Additionally, the caregiver may wish to place bales of straw around the enclosure to help maintain warmth for the confined cats. 
        During spells of freezing weather, the caretaker must be sure to give fresh water throughout the day as the cat’s water becomes frozen. There are various devices available to keep water bowls from freezing. 
        In summer, proper ventilation is vital to prevent cats from overheating.

      <h2>What Happens After the Confinement Period?</h2>
      <p><strong>If your cats are in an enclosure (not confined in crates):</strong>
        Choose a day that you are home all day. Release early in the morning when the sun is up. All you’ll do is open the enclosure door and allow the cats to come out on their own. 
        You’ll leave their enclosure set up exactly same way indefinitely (if this is not possible, leave their setup untouched for 1-2 weeks minimum); it’s their safe zone, and they will continue to come back to that. 
        Continue to feed in the enclosure and then feed in the new area (if applicable). When you release the cats, make sure you continue to give them wet food morning and night. Do not release when it’s raining or the day before or after it’s rained.
      </p>
      <p><strong>If your crates are set up in a barn or other structure that is enclosed:</strong>
        It’s best to close all doors and windows in the barn, open the crate door in the evening, then leave. The cats will want to explore their new surroundings all night, as they are nocturnal. 
        By morning, they will have found good hiding places, although they may prefer the security of their crate. You can ease the transition by continuing to place their food and water in the crate for a few days with the door open. 
        You will need to continue providing daily food and water. After 1-2 days, or when you feel the cats have gotten used to their enclosure/barn with the door closed, you will open the barn/enclosure door early in the morning the following day, and allow the cats to walk out on their own.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>DO NOT RELEASE IF IT IS RAINING or there is POTENTIAL FOR RAIN</strong></h2>
      <p>Cats find their home by scent and rain will wash it away. Waiting one more day will not hurt. Leave the crates up for an additional five days, so the cats can get back in if they want. After the release, we hope they think of that barn as home and decide to stay.</p>
      <h2>Anything Else I Can Do to Help Them Stick Around?</h2>
      <p>
        Cats are territorial creatures. They will usually maintain a home base once their scent has been established, a continuous food source has been provided, and they feel safe.
        The key to success will be your patience while they adapt to the sights, sounds and smells of their new surroundings. Continue to speak softly to them, try hand feeding treats and leave a radio on to help them get used to human talking and singing.
